    <b>Casey Schultz</b>, a classically trained instructor of percussion, upright and electric bass, guitars, and piano, pulls influence across a range of artists: from the layered Daft Punk to Tool’s thoughtful time signatures. Casey crafts original melodies with plenty of drive.

    <b>Mary Cay Schultz</b>, composer and conductor for string orchestras at The Bastrop Academy of Music, also instructs upon a range of instruments. An example of her writing influences are the industrial rhythms of George Gershwin and riffs from Soundgarden. Her favorite thing about PttP is confidence in the skills of her fellow bandmates.

    <p>
    <b>Ruben Munoz</b> brings extensive experience on bass: inspired by Geddy Lee from Rush, as well as the soulful rock of Phil Lynott from Thin Lizzy. Ruben’s ability to write a grounded melody is a major contribution to the band.

    The band is known for jumping songs that sometimes splash through alternative beats. Although Playing to the Plants is new, their experience is well-seasoned; coming out of a long music relationship within Spectra. That former project had played for years, all up and down Sixth Street in Austin, including a residency at the “Bat Bar”. Spectra played regularly at “Grace’s Miller’s” in Bastrop, and well as “The Roadhouse” in Paige. They reached down to play places such as “Pat Obrien’s” near the Riverwalk, as well as an array of other venues in the Central Texas area. They’ve played everything from biker rallies, to jamborees, festivals, and weddings. A track called “Socks” from their album “A Piece of Work” made radio play on KLBJ’s “Local Licks Live” out of Austin. And now, the new sound of Playing to the Plants is streaming at their channel on Youtube.
